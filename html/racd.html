                The .racd file format, or by the full name: <a href="https://www.gridsagegames.com/rexpaint/" target="_blank">RexPaint</a>
                Animated Compressed Document, is a custom built file structure intended to add animation to the software's capability.
                Rexpaint supports export in several file formats including .xp and .csv files, in the interest of compatibility a .racd file can be compiled from either
                a folder of .csv or .xp files or a single .xp file utilizing the layers created by Rexpaint as different frames. The project as a whole is intended to 
                enable the use of Rexpaint as a tool for sprite animation for use in graphics libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod" target="_blank">LibTcod</a>
                and <a href="https://github.com/tommyettinger/BearLibTerminal" target="_blank">BearLibTerminal</a>.

            <h3>
                Overview 
            </h3>
            <p>
                .racd is a compiled binary format, the file data itself is created at runtime within the compile program, stripping redundant and repeating data 
                in addition to identifying error cases in the event of missing files, frames, or corrupted input. Due to this nature as a binary format a hex editor
                is the only option to directly edit a .racd file at this time. This is not recommended, as much of the data contained in the RACD format is NOT PARSED
                BY BYTES. Many of the data fields used by the format are only a few bits in size, As these fields are combined for the process of compilation, 
                editing the wrong bytes of a .racd file may result in the corruption of the entire file, making it unreadable. should edits be made to an animation 
                it is heavily recommended to recompile the file rather than editing it. Components stored within a .racd file include but are not limited to:

                <h3>Header and Metadata</h3>
                <p>
                    The head of a .racd file is the only section of the file that is static in length and contains data on: encoding, framerate, animation timing,
                    number of frames as well as bool values that determine the presence of a loop or custom id to the file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data contained within the head is divided into four bytes, this is the fixed length of this field, and is the constriction placed on the format.
                    the full structure is as follows:

                <h3>Error Codes</h3>
                <p>
                    There are three reserved bits in the format for the purpose of error checking. One in the head, one in each frame count, and one in the behavior byte of each
                    tile. Of these, the reserved bits in the head and tile fields are fatal to the file, and no read will be completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ideally no error codes are required as a unreadable file should not compile at all, however these errors are left as a check anyways for runtime. Each code serves
                    a different role:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Head - byte 3 bit 0: <span style="color: crimson;">Fatal</span>: No file / frames exist OR source file invalid and ignored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frame Count - byte 1 bit 0: <span style="color: chartreuse;">Recoverable</span>: Missing or corrupted frame block, enters search for next frame count bytes. This is not perfect
                    and is dependent on content present but offers a possibility of recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tile Behavior - byte 1 bit 0: <span style="color: crimson;">Fatal</span>: Tile is incorrect and unreadable, behavior is not correct and no data thereafter is reachable. 
                </p>
